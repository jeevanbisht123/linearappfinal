step 1: create a new conda environment
         conda create -n linearapp python==3.6.9
         conda activate linearapp

Step 2: Install the requiremnents file(sometimes u have to install each file manually also using pip install)
       pip install -r requirements.txt
        if this not works , then type command
        cd file location (this step is to take your interpreter in the folder your file is )
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python main.py (this will give u the url check in that url whether the code is working or not)

 NOTE: IF YOUR CODE IS NOT RUNNING THEN AND ALSO RUNNING IN OTHER CODE WHAT YOU CAN DO YOU CAN SELECT THE CONDA
 ENVIRONMENT (PYTHON.EXE FILE) FOR THAT CODE WHICH IS RUNNING

note: delete the git folder if present in linear regression app folder
note: MAKE SURE IN CODE YOU CHOOSE THROUGH SETTING YOU COOSE THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH U HAVE INSTALLED THE
REQUIREMNET.TXT LIBRARIES FOR THAT GO TO SETTING CONDA ENVIRONMENT AND THEN EXISTING ENVIRONMENT THEN SLECT
LINER APP NOT ANY OTHER ...MAKE SURE THIS
Step 3: create a Procfile and write web: gunicorn app:app in it. ist app is app.py and 2nd app is flask object
so make the flask object in app.py from application to app.py
go to application word right click and select refractor and rename the application to aoo, it wil change the
application to app in whole code

Step4: make a new file app.py and copy paste the main.py to app.py

step5: go to the folder location , right click for windows user can find gitbash here click it and type git init
then it will create .git folder in the folder u r working

step6: git add .
       git status
       git commit -m "initial commit"

       heroku login
       git remote -v
       git push heroku master
